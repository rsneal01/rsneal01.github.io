Section 2, Classes and Instances, introduces the ruby concept of the class.  I found the analogy of the blueprint as a helpful way to think about classes.  A blueprint is not he object itself, but rather contains the information and behavior of the object that it will create.  I think it is helpful because it allows us to manufacture objects on a large scale without the repetition of hard coding the same data over and over again.  Classes allow us to make unique object instances, that have their own ID, in a quick and effecient process.  

So classes act like a factory for producing objects.  What seems great about this is that it allows for further abstraction, making the code more elegant and effecient.  Moreover, since classes can be programmed to contain instance methods, we can give all of our indivual objects the ability to execute methods without needing to write that method each and every time we create the object.  Right from their creation, an instance of our class blueprint can have the ability to perform useful functions.  And we only need to write this function once, even if we have dozens of instances.  

All in all, classes and instances seem like a powerful tool instreamlining our code, making it more abstract, and giving it the flexibility to be easily changed without breaking in the future.
