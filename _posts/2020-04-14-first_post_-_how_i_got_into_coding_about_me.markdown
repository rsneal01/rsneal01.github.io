My name is Robert Neal (I go by Bobby).  I am a elementary school teacher from beautiful Bend, Oregon.  I became interested in making a career change this year.  After reading so many good things about the growing field of Software Development, I took an interest.  I read that it was a field with many job openings, offered some flexibility of remote working, and was generally interesting and rewarding.  I also read that it could be quite challenging (and frustrating at times), which has proven to be true so far.  But even just as a beginner student, completing simple labs after working away at error messages has offered a sense of satisfaction that I hope will continue to drive me through the frustrating moments.  

In my free time, I enjoy PC gaming with friends.  Games have been a medium that has brought many of my old friends together to reconnect in a super fun way.  It has also led me to meet several new friends who have become very close.  The possibility of working to develop software for a gaming studio is one prospect that I find inspiring about my coding journey.

In my free time, I also love to get outdoors (Bend is located in central Oregon, which is home to many lakes, waterfalls, hiking trails, outdoor sports).  I am passionate about meditation and piano, spend lots of time with my fiance and cats watching quality TV shows, and generally try to live a happy life.

I am looking forward to my journey at Flatiron School, and hope that if I meet the challenges with patience and determination that my education here will open up possibilities for my future happiness.
